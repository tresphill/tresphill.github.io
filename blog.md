# Week One is almost behind us!

## i. Was your first week what you expected? Why? Why not?

I have to say, it was everything I expected - because - I expected it to be **very** hard. :sweat_smile:
I am however, still quite confident in my ability to "FITFO."

## ii. What are you excited or eager to learn more about?

I'm eager to get into more CSS because I like to design and make things nice. More terrifed about learning JS.

## iii. What is something about you that can only be learned by reading this blog?

My birth name is **not** Tres or Phillips!

# Week Two - in the books. :book:

## i. What is something you wish you could do but currently do not have the coding skills to accomplish?

I wish I could design a small little game for my friends to play. We're big gamers and I think they would love that.

## ii. What are you struggling with? How do you solve a problem?

Right now I'm currently struggling with time management. There's a lot of information and work to be done and I catch myself spending too much time racking my brain. 
This is being solved by understanding I dont have to know it all. Repetition has helped a ton so far. 

## iii. What methods do you use to help yourself get unstuck?

Walking away for a bit seems to help a lot. I tend to spend a lot of time with my plants and talking myself through whatever problem is at hand.

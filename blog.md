# Week One is almost behind us!

## i. Was your first week what you expected? Why? Why not?
I have to say, it was everything I expected - because - I expected it to be **very** hard. :sweat_smile:
I am however, still quite confident in my ability to "FITFO."

## ii. What are you excited or eager to learn more about?
I'm eager to get into more CSS because I like to design and make things nice. More terrifed about learning JS.

## iii. What is something about you that can only be learned by reading this blog?
My birth name is **not** Tres or Phillips!
